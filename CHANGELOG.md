# Changelog

Notable and interesting changes will go in this file whenever a new release goes out. Boring changes will probably go in here too. Really, all changes are welcome.

## 0.1.0

Initial release of `vscode-overtype`. I take no responsibility if it formats your hard drive or punches you in the nose. (But if it does, please open an issue.)
