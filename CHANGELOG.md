# Changelog

Notable and interesting changes will go in this file whenever a new release goes out. Boring changes will probably go in here too. Really, all changes are welcome.

## TO BE ANNOUNCED

- New configuration `overtype.showInStatusBar`, to allow hiding the current state in the status bar [#4](https://github.com/DrMerfy/vscode-overtype/issues/4).
- The item in the status bar can now be clicked to toggle the insert mode [#3](https://github.com/DrMerfy/vscode-overtype/issues/3).

## 0.3.1

- open-vsx ready, now also found at https://open-vsx.org/extension/DrMerfy/overtype

## 0.3.0

- Continuation fork of the project.
- New configuration `overtype.secondaryCursorStyle`, to change the overtype cursor style.

## 0.2.0

- Fixed an issue where the status indicator/cursor wouldn't be correct when Visual Studio Code opens a window with editors already open.
- Added an animated GIF to the README! (There will be more of these in the future.)

## 0.1.1

Fixed the README. I promise to pay more attention next time.

## 0.1.0

Initial release of `vscode-overtype`. I take no responsibility if it formats your hard drive or punches you in the nose. (But if it does, please open an issue.)
