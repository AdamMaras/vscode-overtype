# Changelog

Notable and interesting changes will go in this file whenever a new release goes out. Boring changes will probably go in here too. Really, all changes are welcome.

## 0.2.0

- Fixed an issue where the status indicator/cursor wouldn't be correct when Visual Studio Code opens a window with editors already open.
- Added an animated GIF to the README! (There will be more of these in the future.)

## 0.1.1

Fixed the README. I promise to pay more attention next time.

## 0.1.0

Initial release of `vscode-overtype`. I take no responsibility if it formats your hard drive or punches you in the nose. (But if it does, please open an issue.)
